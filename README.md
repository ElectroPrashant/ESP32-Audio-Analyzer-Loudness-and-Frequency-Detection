# ESP32-Audio-Analyzer-Loudness-and-Frequency-Detection
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 microcontroller with an I2S microphone (e.g., INMP441) to measure audio loudness and detect dominant frequencies in real-time. By analyzing audio signals, this setup lays the groundwork for implementing noise cancellation techniques.
